# Exercise-3.11.-Kubernetes
This diagram was created as part of Exercise 3.11: Kubernetes from the University of Helsinki's MOOC course DevOps with Docker 2025. It illustrates the architecture of a Kubernetes cluster running two applications, including external interactions and internal components.

# Short Description
The diagram demonstrates the architecture of a Kubernetes cluster with one master node, three worker nodes (including a backup node for high availability), and two applications: a video game server and a blog website. It includes external interactions such as HTTP requests, database connections, and PersistentVolume usage, as well as key Kubernetes components like Pods, Services, and CRI.
